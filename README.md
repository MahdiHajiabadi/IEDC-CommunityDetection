#IEDC: An Integrated Approach for Overlapping and

Abstract

Community detection is a task of fundamental importance in social network
analysis. Community structures enable us to discover the hidden interactions
among the network members that can be used in many knowledge-based do-
mains such as bioinformatics, computer networks, e-commerce and forensic
science. While there exist many works on community detection based on
connectivity structure, they suffer from either considering the overlapping
or non-overlapping community structures. In this work, we propose a novel
approach for general community detection through an integrated framework
to extract the overlapping and non-overlapping community structures with-
out assuming prior structural connectivity on the networks. Our general
framework is based on a primary node based criterion which consists up
the internal association degree along with the external association degree to
compute the criterion in the proposed approach. The evaluation of the pro-
posed method is investigated through the extensive simulation experiments
and several benchmark real network data-sets. The experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the earlier state-of-the-art algorithms
based on the well-known evaluation criteria.
